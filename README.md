# leafblower
A Google search tool originally designed to find Canadian MAP violators.

Leafblower allows the user to search a query on Google, and only pull up results whose IP addresses belong to a specified country.

USAGE:
In the config file, use the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Code to specify the country you'd like to search in.
For example, if you want to pull up Canadian results, use "CA". If you want to pull up Turkish results, use "TR". Et cetera.
